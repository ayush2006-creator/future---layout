  <p id="container1"> <span>Cars</span> <br>One hundred years ago, cars were incredibly basic compared to the cars of today
    . The same will be said in a century's time. In the present day, we are making massive strides in
     car development with the likes of Google and Tesla testing self-driving and electric cars. The 
     technology behind electric cars is developing quicker and eventually cheap electric models 
     will become a dominant presence on our roads.Your car in the future will be fully-electric and 
     the last combustible engine
     died out decades before. You will have the option to drive it, but you will prefer to be chauf
     feured around in your self-driving car. By removing the human aspect, accidents have dropped 
     to a record low as the cars computers predict and avoid any aspect that could result in a
      crash.This is down to software using archived data, GPS and roadside sensors to ensure our
       car knows where a problem is and to avoid it. You will enjoy those extra few minutes in bed and get home early.</p>

    In a hundred years we will have direct connection to our brains which will enable us to make
     so realistic simulations that we won't be able to tell reality and simulation apart. Why? 
     Because the machine will directly effect our senses : what we see, what we smell, 
     what we feel..<a  id="readmore"href="/sample2.html">read more</a>

  <p id="container3"> <span>Pipe §Net</span><br> is  an innovative solution for the transport of goods via depressurised pipes. This technology is often referred to as the "fifth mode of transport" and constitutes a sustainable alternative to existing transport modes. The goal of Pipe §Net is to relieve congested European transportation networks and to provide a fast, reliable and safe way of transport. The pipes can easily be built alongside existing infrastructure (e.g., road, railway) and allow for the transportation of goods in standardised containers with up to 1,500 km/h. Furthermore, 70% of the energy can be recovered during the braking process which creates an energy-efficient solution. It consists of a low-cost, environmentally sustainable network of pipes with linear electrical frictionless engines powered by renewable energy sources where encapsulated goods are transported at a velocity >1500 km/h with a transportation capability equal to 1 ton/sec (see ciriaf.it/pipenet). This creates a physical internet consisting of a real network where products can be quickly transported from one location to another in real time. The last km of delivery can be implemented by drones.
