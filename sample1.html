  <p class="container"><span>Assumptions</span><br> WE may also see robots as a more integral part of our daily routine.
     In our homes, many simple tasks such as cooking and cleaning may be totally automated.
      Similarly, with robots that can use computer vision and natural language processing, 
      we may see machines that can interact with the world more, such as self-driving cars and
       digital assistants. Robotics may also shape the future of medicine. Surgical robots 
       can perform extremely precise operations, and with advances in AI, could eventually 
       carry out surgeries independently. The ability for machines and robots to learn could give
        them an even more diverse range of applications. Future robots that can adapt to their 
        surroundings, master new processes, and alter their behaviour would be suited to more 
        complex and dynamic tasks.Ultimately, robots have the potential to enhance our lives.
        As well as shouldering the burden of physically demanding or repetitive tasks, they may
        be able to improve healthcare, make transport more efficient, and give us more freedom
         to pursue creative endeavours. </p>

    <span>Rescue Robots</span><br> your are lost  deep in the forest on a cold autumn night and nightfall is 
    rapidly approaching. Too windy for search aircraft and too dark for ground teams, this could be
     a life threatening situation. Fortunately for you, it is ten years into the future and hundreds
      of tiny intelligent robots will be combing the woods for you throughout the night.All terrain 
      robots (ATRs), will truly function as a team by sharing their locations, discoveries, 
      search patterns and more. Large ATRs could carry many smaller robots and provide them with 
      localized control and power.These smaller more specialized robots will have cameras, sonar, 
      heat sensors, motion detectors and can be sent out by the large ATRs as needed. Smaller robots
       might work together to perform tasks such as moving a large obstacle.

  <p class="container"style="font-size:x-large;"><span>Exoskeleton robots</span><br>
    Wearable bionic suits specifically are being developed for the fairly military to generally 
    allow soldiers to definitely carry sort of heavier loads and to conserve energy in a pretty 
    big way. Other for the most part uses for exoskeletons kind of are assisting rescue workers
     move very heavy objects and assisted-limbs or bionics mostly help people that need it, which 
     mostly is fairly significant.

  <p class="container"style="font-size:x-large;"><span>Robotic Competitions</span><br>
    The ultimate goal of the RoboCup project is to develop a team of fully autonomous humanoid 
    robots that can win against the human world champion team in soccer by the year 2050.The FIRST
     Robotics Competition challenges teams of young people and their mentors to solve a common
      problem in a six-week timeframe using a standard "kit of parts" and a common set of rules. 
      Teams build robots from the parts and enter them in competitions.
