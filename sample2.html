  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Gaming</h1>
  <p class="container" style="font-size:x-large;"> <span>Introduction</span> <br>A major moment in the world of gaming was when games stopped being confined to boards.
     Classic game chess could be played on an electronic interface. The progression in games 
     especially electronically in the past 20 years has been phenomenal. From being restricted 
     to playing against artificial intelligence to multi- player gaming. From the 2D games to 3D
    games and more recently Virtual Reality. There is no end in sight for the advancements in 
    technology that supports gaming. On the other hand, online gaming is extremely well known and 
    its future is shaped by what we do today, where is gaming technology going and what we
    expect in future? Visit casinoaus to review more advanced casino games.</p>

  <p class="container"style="font-size:x-large;"><span>Money</span> <br>The reason the technological advancements are expected to continue is that of the money. 
    There is just too much money in gaming. Major corporations are investing big money into
    research and development of the next revolutionary gaming platforms and systems. Online gambling
    for real money is a one market segment that is also pushing the technology along. The desire to 
    give the ultimate online gaming experience will test the ingenuity of the game makers.

  <p class ="container"style="font-size:x-large;"> <span>Future</span> <br>
    Some 100 years from now, it would not be surprising that there will be an
    unidentifiable form Virtual Reality. Gaming systems will not be as bulky as the ones we have today.
    There is also a great possibility that the portability and enhanced VR capabilities might lead to 
    games being connected directly to the player. Allowing the player to control the game characters 
    with their thoughts through electrical impulses. Mind-boggling stuff.we will have direct connection to our brains which will enable us to make
    so realistic simulations that we won't be able to tell reality and simulation apart. Why? 
    Because the machine will directly effect our senses : what we see, what we smell, 
    what we feel..
