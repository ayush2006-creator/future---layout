  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Space Exploration</h1>
  <p class="container"style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 18px;padding-bottom:35px"> <span>Introduction</span><br>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore 
    outer space. While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes,
     its physical exploration though is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. 
     Popular space agencies are NASA ISRO SpaceX .

  <p class="container"style="font-size:x-large; padding-top: 18px;padding-bottom:35px"><span>Networking</span><br> the space technologies of the future, this years 5G roll-out has 
    certainly caused a stir. 5Gs Non-Terrestrial Network relies on communication between satellites 
    to create faster mobile connections for those of us on Earth. 5G will also create possibilities
    for mobile connections at locations outside the range of terrestrial signals, such as on 
    transport or in very remote areas.</p>

  <p class="container" style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 18px;padding-bottom:35px"><span>Colonisation</span><br>Establishing colonies on other planets is likely to play a large role in space
     technology in the future. From 3D-printed homes on Mars to Martian outposts with nuclear 
     energy supplies, these extra-terrestrial territories are the new imaginative frontier. NASA even 
     predicts something like this could exist by 2030.

  <p class="container"style="font-size:x-large;padding-top: 18px;padding-bottom:35px">  <span>Comercial Space Travel</span><br>Commercial space travel is still a fairly sci-fi idea, even with modern space
     technology. However, companies like Jeff Bezos Blue Origin and Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic
    aim to create this very thing, and sooner than you might expect. Virgin Galactica has allegedly
    already taken up to 600 deposits for passengers booked on the first commercial flight that 
    could take off in the next few years </p>

    The field of space technology is an ever-evolving and highly dynamic modern industry. Thereâ€™s
     certainly no shortage of future space tech news with seemingly endless possibilities for
    knowledge development, space exploration, and even commercial ventures. Our blog aims to 
    examine all the latest advances in extra-terrestrial exploration and keep you up to date on
    the matter.</p>
